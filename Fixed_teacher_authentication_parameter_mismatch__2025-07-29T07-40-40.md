[ ] NAME:Current Task List DESCRIPTION:Root task for conversation **NEW_AGENT** -[x] NAME:Fix Sidebar Collapse User Profile Issue DESCRIPTION:Address the responsive design issue where the user profile section becomes too narrow and unusable when the sidebar is collapsed using the toggle button. The NavUser component needs to handle collapsed state properly with tooltips and appropriate spacing.
--[x] NAME:Analyze Current Sidebar Collapse Behavior DESCRIPTION:Examine the current sidebar implementation in components/ui/sidebar.tsx and components/dashboard/nav-user.tsx to understand how the collapse state affects the user profile section. Identify specific CSS classes and responsive behavior issues.
--[x] NAME:Implement Collapsed State Handling for NavUser DESCRIPTION:Modify the NavUser component to detect sidebar collapse state using useSidebar hook and implement appropriate UI changes: show only avatar in collapsed state, add tooltip with user info, ensure proper spacing and click interactions.
--[x] NAME:Test Sidebar Collapse Functionality DESCRIPTION:Test the sidebar collapse/expand functionality across different screen sizes and ensure the user profile section remains functional and visually appealing in both states. Verify tooltip behavior and dropdown menu positioning. -[x] NAME:Implement Dynamic Breadcrumb Navigation DESCRIPTION:Replace the static 'Current Page' breadcrumb with dynamic navigation that reflects the actual current page name and path. Create a breadcrumb context or hook that updates based on the current route and page metadata.
--[x] NAME:Create Breadcrumb Context/Hook DESCRIPTION:Create a React context and custom hook to manage breadcrumb state throughout the application. This should track the current page title, path segments, and provide methods to update breadcrumb information dynamically.
--[x] NAME:Map Routes to Page Metadata DESCRIPTION:Create a mapping system that associates each dashboard route with its corresponding page metadata (title, parent pages, etc.). This should include all existing pages: Classes, Students, Subjects, Credit Classes, Student Grades, Reports, Course Registration, Tuition Payment, Settings.
--[x] NAME:Update Dashboard Layout with Dynamic Breadcrumbs DESCRIPTION:Modify app/dashboard/layout.tsx to use the new breadcrumb context and display dynamic breadcrumbs instead of the static 'Current Page' text. Ensure proper navigation links and current page highlighting.
--[x] NAME:Test Breadcrumb Navigation DESCRIPTION:Test breadcrumb functionality across all dashboard pages, verify correct page titles are displayed, navigation links work properly, and the breadcrumb updates correctly when navigating between pages. -[ ] NAME:Optimize Add/Edit Class Modal Performance DESCRIPTION:Investigate and fix the noticeable delay when opening Add Class or Edit Class modals. Implement lazy loading, optimize component rendering, and ensure smooth modal transitions.
--[ ] NAME:Profile Modal Loading Performance DESCRIPTION:Analyze the current modal implementation in app/dashboard/classes/page.tsx and identify performance bottlenecks. Check for unnecessary re-renders, heavy computations, or blocking operations that cause delays when opening modals.
--[ ] NAME:Implement Modal Lazy Loading DESCRIPTION:Implement lazy loading for modal components to reduce initial bundle size and improve loading performance. Use React.lazy() and Suspense for modal content that doesn't need to be loaded immediately.
--[ ] NAME:Optimize Modal State Management DESCRIPTION:Review and optimize modal state management, form data initialization, and API calls. Ensure that data fetching and form setup don't block the modal opening animation.
--[ ] NAME:Add Loading States and Transitions DESCRIPTION:Implement proper loading states, skeleton loaders, and smooth transitions for modal opening/closing. Add visual feedback to improve perceived performance even if actual loading time remains the same. -[ ] NAME:Implement Inline Form Validation DESCRIPTION:Replace toast-based form validation with inline field validation using shadcn/ui form components. Show error messages directly under input fields that have validation issues instead of using toast notifications or alerts.
--[ ] NAME:Audit Current Form Validation Patterns DESCRIPTION:Review all existing forms in the application (classes, subjects, credit-classes, settings, login) to identify where toast-based validation is currently used. Document the current validation logic and error handling patterns.
--[ ] NAME:Implement React Hook Form Integration DESCRIPTION:Set up React Hook Form with Zod validation schema for form validation. Create reusable form components using shadcn/ui Form components (FormField, FormItem, FormLabel, FormControl, FormMessage) to replace current validation approach.
--[ ] NAME:Convert Classes Form to Inline Validation DESCRIPTION:Update the Add/Edit Class forms in app/dashboard/classes/page.tsx to use inline validation with React Hook Form. Replace toast error messages with FormMessage components that appear directly under each input field.
--[ ] NAME:Convert Subjects Form to Inline Validation DESCRIPTION:Update the subjects form in app/dashboard/subjects/page.tsx to use the new inline validation pattern. The subjects page already has some inline validation logic that can be enhanced with proper FormMessage components.
--[ ] NAME:Convert Credit Classes Form to Inline Validation DESCRIPTION:Update the credit classes forms in app/dashboard/credit-classes/page.tsx to use inline validation. Replace the current toast-based validation with proper field-level error messages.
--[ ] NAME:Test Form Validation Across All Forms DESCRIPTION:Thoroughly test the new inline validation system across all forms. Verify that error messages appear correctly, validation triggers at appropriate times (on blur, on submit), and the user experience is improved. -[x] NAME:Create Student API Route DESCRIPTION:Create app/api/students/route.ts with GET, POST, PUT, DELETE methods for student management. Include functionality to fetch students by department, add new students, update existing students, and delete students. Use the STUDENT table structure from the database schema. -[x] NAME:Create Student Page Component DESCRIPTION:Create app/dashboard/students/page.tsx with similar functionality to classes page. Include student listing, search functionality, department filtering, add/edit/delete modals, and proper error handling with toast notifications. -[x] NAME:Implement Student Data Types DESCRIPTION:Define TypeScript interfaces for student data based on the STUDENT table schema: STUDENT_ID, LAST_NAME, FIRST_NAME, GENDER, ADDRESS, DATE_OF_BIRTH, CLASS_ID, SUSPENDED, PASSWORD. -[x] NAME:Add Student Form Validation DESCRIPTION:Implement form validation for student data including required fields, proper date format for DATE_OF_BIRTH, gender selection, and class ID validation. -[x] NAME:Test Student Page Functionality DESCRIPTION:Test all student page features including loading students by department, adding new students, editing existing students, deleting students, search functionality, and proper error handling.
